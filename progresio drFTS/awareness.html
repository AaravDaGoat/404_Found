        <h2>Severity of Waterborne Diseases</h2>
        <p>
            Waterborne infections are one of humanity's most persistent
            and economically destructive biological threats. In impoverished
            nations, waterborne diseases cause four-fifths of all illnesses,
            with diarrhea being the leading cause of pediatric mortality.
            Each year, an estimated 1.8 million people are killed by waterborne
            illnesses such as cholera, typhoid, urinary tract infections,
            schistosomiasis, and other diarrheal diseases. Despite this, waterborne
            diarrhea remains a prominent cause of mortality and disease among children
            in developing countries, accounting for 90% of diarrhea deaths in children
            under the age of five.

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
            To prevent such diseases from occurring, we can take certain precautions
            which will help provide a safer environment free of waterborne diseases.
            These include washing fruits and vegetables well, washing hands often, and
            drinking safe water. To treat the diseases, drink plenty of safe water, rest,
            and taking over-the-counter diarrheal medication is important.
